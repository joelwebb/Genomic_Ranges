#Genomic Ranges Assignment

Your genomic ranges assignment will consist of two simple components:

1. Create an R Markdown file for the workflow described in slides 132-139 of the Genomic Ranges lecture (see Chapter 9, pp 325-327, in Buffalo for more details on this workflow). In this example you will learn how to extract variants by exons that are represented by genomic ranges.

2. Write a file (and include this in your assignment repository) in which you append a column including the number of variants per exon (see slide 139).

For those of you interested in five points of extra credit, create an R Markdown file for the exercise described in Buffalo pp. 314-319 in which promoter ranges are created and sequence within these ranges is then extracted. Be sure to include a file with the sequences of the the promoters you extract in your assignment repository.
